# Bed Leveling

## Introduction
Leveling the bed of your  3D printer is an important step in achieving successful 3D prints. If the bed is not level, the nozzle may be too far from the bed or too close, leading to poor adhesion or failed prints. This tutorial will guide you through the process of leveling the bed on an Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, you should have the following:

- Filament loaded into the printer
- A piece of paper or a feeler gauge
- A clean, flat surface to work on

## Steps
1. Ensure that the printer is turned on and that the build plate is at room temperature.
2. Navigate to the "Maintenance" menu on the printer's display and select "Build plate."
3. Select "Level build plate" and then "Start."
4. The printer will move the nozzle to three points on the build plate and prompt you to adjust the height of the build plate at each point using the paper or feeler gauge.
5. At the first point, slide the paper or feeler gauge between the nozzle and the build plate. Adjust the height of the build plate until you feel a slight resistance when moving the paper or gauge.
6. Repeat this process for the other two points.

Once you have leveled the bed at all three points, the printer will prompt you to confirm the settings.
Check that the distance between the nozzle and the build plate is consistent across the entire surface of the bed by using the paper or feeler gauge.
If necessary, make any additional adjustments to the build plate height to ensure that the nozzle is the correct distance from the build plate.
Once you are satisfied with the bed level, select "Save" on the printer's display to save the settings.
