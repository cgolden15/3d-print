# Printing

The hard part is done! All you need to do now, is walk over to the printer and start your print!

## Turning the printer on:

First, locate the power switch on the back of the printer & ensure that the printer is plugged into an outlet. Turn on the power switch by pressing it to the "on" position. The printer should begin to power on and go through its start-up sequence. You may hear the printer's fans start up and see lights turn on. Once the printer has finished starting up, you can begin using it.  

## Starting your print:

Once the printer is displaying the main menu screen, use the dial to scroll and click through the menu's. To start your print, click the "Print" button and find your file; click on it & confirm that you wish to start the print. If done correctly, the printer should start heating up the extruder hotend & build plate(depending on printer). After they have reached temp, the printer will begin your print by extruding a small amount of fillament in the corner of the build plate to clear out any old material. After this it will begin your print. Stand by the printer for a minute or two to make sure that it is correctly printing your model. 

*If something seems off* stop the print by clicking the "tune" button displayed on the screen and then the "abort" button. Consult your teacher and the troubleshooting section of this guide on how to proceed.

## After your print finishes:

After your print has finished, carefully pull it off of the build plate(this may take some force) and remove any support or adhesion structures. Some simple reccomened tools to do this are flush cutters & sandpaper. If your print does not look good, consider checking out the troubleshooting section.
