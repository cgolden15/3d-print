## Introduction:
Welcome to this complete 3D printing tutorial, specifically designed for Pennsbury High School, where we'll guide you through the entire process of turning your 3D model into a physical object. Whether you're new to 3D printing or an experienced maker, this guide will cover everything from preparing your model for printing through slicing and preparing your printer, printing your model, and finishing it to perfection. By following this tutorial, you'll gain a thorough understanding of the 3D printing process and be able to create your own high-quality prints. Let's get started!


This tutorial will assume you have a basic understanding of a 3d modeling program such as Fusion360(used in this documentation), Onshape, Tinkercad, etc. Fusion360 and Onshape are free for students within Pennsbury. If you do not already have access to this, ask your teacher! No extra software is needed, except Ultimaker Cura which is by default installed on all Tech class computers. 

For simplicity, this documentation is built around Ultimaker 3D printers, as that is what is currently run in a majority of classes. However, if you are lucky enough to be using our Ender series printer(s) or unlucky enough to be using a JGAURA, the entire process should be about the same. If you have any questions, ASK. 3D printers are not cheap and you don't want to have to pay for repairs. That said, if you don't know what something does, if you are confused or if something seems off, ask your teacher, there's no shame in that!


## Getting Started: 

So, you have your 3D model, in all its glory, perfected. You are ready to finally bring it into reality! Before we do this however, there are a few things we need to first. All steps will be explained in more detail below, but they are in order, as follows. 
- Exporting model to Cura
- Slicing model
- Starting print

### Exporting your modelL

There are two methods to export your model from Fusion360 into Cura, they are both the same, so do whever is easier for you. 

#### Direct Export:

To Directly export your model into Cura, navigate to your file settings in Fusion and click "3D Print".

To proceed, you will need to select the model you want to export. As soon as you open the 3d print menu, you can simply click on the part you wish to export and it will select it.
