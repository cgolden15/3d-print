# Exporting your model:

There are two methods to export your model from Fusion360 into Cura, they are both the same, so do whever is easier for you. 

## Direct Export:

To Directly export your model into Cura, navigate to your file settings in Fusion and click "3D Print". Now you will need to select the model you want to export. As soon as you open the 3d print menu, you can simply click on the part you wish to export and it will select it.

From here, look under the "Output" section of the menu. Make sure "Cura" is selected. In some instances, such as in this example, Cura is added under the "Custom" option, however you should not need to do this.
