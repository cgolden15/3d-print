# Exporting your model:

There are two methods to export your model from Fusion360 into Cura, they are both the same, so do whever is easier for you. Directly exporting your model into cura is the easiest, however if you want to back your model up to your computer, or anything else you will need to use the download/upload method.

## Direct Export:

To directly export your model into Cura, navigate to your file settings in Fusion and click "3D Print":

Now you will need to select the model you want to export. As soon as you open the 3d print menu, you can simply click on the part you wish to export and it will select it. From here, look under the "Output" section of the menu. Make sure "Cura" is selected. In some instances, such as in this example, Cura is added under the "Custom" option, however you should not need to do this:

Finally, hit the "Ok" button and wait for Cura to load! You can now move on to the next section, [Slicing your model](https://goldenn.dev/3d-printing/slicing)!
