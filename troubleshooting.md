## Whats going wrong:

Not sure whats going wrong? Check out these examples to figure out whats happening!

### Material not sticking to the build plate:

If the bed is not level, the nozzle may be too far from the bed or too close, leading to poor adhesion between the printed object and the build surface. To fix this, check out the "bed leveling" guide.

### The bottom of my model is warped:

Warping in 3D printing is where the edges or corners of your printed object curl up or pull away from the print bed during the printing process. This occurs when the material of the printed object contracts as it cools, causing stress and deformation at the bottom of the object. To fix this, check out our bed leveling guide.
